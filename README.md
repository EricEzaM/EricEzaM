### G'day 👋

👷‍ I have contributed quite a bit to the Godot Game Engine. See all my pull requests [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEricEzaM+), or only the merged ones [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+author%3AEricEzaM)!  
🛠 I use C# and .NET to automate tasks in my day job. Python sometimes, but C# is my go-to.  
🕸 Finally finished my personal website! Check it out: [iameric.net](https://www.iameric.net)  
💡 Continuing to learn about .NET in web development.
