### G'day 👋

🏢 Just made OpenDesk public - an office management and desk booking app made with .NET 5, React and Postgres. [Demo](https://opendesk.iameric.net/) & [Repo](https://github.com/EricEzaM/OpenDesk) here!  
👷‍ I have contributed quite a bit to the Godot Game Engine. See all my pull requests [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEricEzaM+), or only the merged ones [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+author%3AEricEzaM)!  
🛠 I use C# (.NET) and Python to develop software tools and automations as part of my work as a Mechanical Engineer.
