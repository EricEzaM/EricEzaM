### G'day 👋

👷‍ I like contibuting to the Godot Engine. See all my pull requests [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEricEzaM+), or only the merged ones [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+author%3AEricEzaM)!  
🛠 I use C# and .NET to automate tasks in my day job. Python sometimes, but C# is my go-to.  
🕸 Almost finished my personal website!  
💡 Continuing to learn about .NET in web development.
